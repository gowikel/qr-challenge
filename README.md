## My process

### Built with

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)


### What I learned

I am working fulltime as a full-stack developer. As such, this was an easy exercise.

However, I mainly use React on my day-to-day work. That's why I used Svelte here. I understand it was an overkill for this application, as you only need some HTML and CSS, but it was a good starting point to learn Svelte.

Futhermore, I've never used Github pages before, and I didn't know that I can upload simple SPA pages to it, as far as I don't use any backend.

### Continued development

I want to continue doing things in Svelte, and in a no long future, go deep in WebRTC technologies.
